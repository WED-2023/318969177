Pat Gelsinger Webpage

    This is a webpage I made about Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel. It containes information about him, photos, a like button, a song, a contact form, and a QR code.

Project Structure

    I've split the project into three main files:

        index.html - The main structure of the webpage.

        style.css - The styling and design.

        web_script.js - The interactive code.


This is the link for the web page:

Accessibility & Design for Older People

I designed this webpage with accessibility in mind, especially for older people. Hereâ€™s how:

    * The font has large spacing between letters to make reading easier.

    * I chose a sans-serif font with fewer decorative elements to improve clarity.

    * The font size is large, making it more readable.

    * The page is rich with images that help illustrate the content and improve understanding.

    * The text is written in simple and clear language, avoiding complex words.

    * The background is emphasized to highlight important elements on the screen.

    * Each section is clearly defined, helping users recognize content boundaries easily.
