Accessibility & Design for Older People

I designed this webpage with accessibility in mind, especially for older people. Hereâ€™s how:

    * The font has large spacing between letters to make reading easier.

    * I chose a sans-serif font with fewer decorative elements to improve clarity.

    * The font size is large, making it more readable.

    * The page is rich with images that help illustrate the content and improve understanding.

    * The text is written in simple and clear language, avoiding complex words.

    * The background is emphasized to highlight important elements on the screen.

    * Each section is clearly defined, helping users recognize content boundaries easily.
